# Images for Song Tiles

This directory contains images that will be displayed on the tiles when they are clicked.

## Image Naming Convention

Images should be named according to the song number:
- `song1.jpg` - Image for the first song (Allantha Doorala)
- `song2.jpg` - Image for the second song (Andala Chukkala Lady)
- `song3.jpg` - Image for the third song (Yemito)
- ... and so on up to `song46.jpg`

## Supported Formats

- `.jpg` or `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.gif`

## Image Guidelines

- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square format)
- Images will be automatically scaled to fit within the tiles
- If an image is not found, the tile will simply show the color without an image

## Adding Images

1. Add your image files to this directory
2. Name them according to the convention above (song1.jpg, song2.jpg, etc.)
3. The website will automatically display them when tiles are clicked
